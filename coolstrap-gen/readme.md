### Contributing to Coolstrap-Generator

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

### Local installation

* Download from the repo
* cd /to/coolstrap-generator && rake install
* ruby -Ilib ./bin/coolstrap # test local bin

### Acknowledgments
  * Coolstrap team - Cristian Ferrari, Abraham Barrera, Felipe Funes - for their awesome work on coolstrap framework.
  * This gem is heavily inspired in Ti gem from Robert Evans, so many of this gorgeous code was taken verbatim from that gem, the main difference is that we adapted the code to work with coolstrap mobile framework and middleman static page generator system.
